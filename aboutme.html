            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a student in my fourth semester at Chippewa Valley Technical College finishing my Associates Degree in Software Development. I plan on graduating from the program in May, and then returning in the fall to finish the Mobile Web Development degree as well.</p>
            <p>I like developing applications and websites in many different languages include ASP.NET, Visual Basic and Java.  I'm also well established in the use of HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.</p>
            <p>I have several projects in working progress.  Many done throughout my college experience with varying levels of knowledge and understanding.  I anticipate revisiting these for improvements both for myself and for the code as time permits.</p>
            <p>I'm currently looking for interesting open-source projects to participate in, and have become familiar with the use of version control through Github.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy designing projects for the Arduino in my spare time.  The number of possibilities that a person can make is incredible to me, and I've always enjoyed the software/hardware interaction through automation.  Much of my past employment history working for Cummins exposed me to the use of automation and sparked my interest in make projects for myself.</p>
